Welcome to inquirer's documentation!
====================================

Overview
--------

Born as a `Inquirer.js`_ clone, it shares part of the goals and philosophy.

So, **Inquirer** should ease the process of asking end user **questions**, **parsing**, **validating** answers, managing **hierarchical prompts** and providing **error feedback**.

You can `download the code from GitHub`.
